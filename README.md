**Personal Activity and Location Measurement System (PALMS)**

PALMS was developed in 2010 by the Center for Wireless and Population Systems (CWPHS) at University of California, San Diego.  PALMS is currently used by over 150 researchers at 90 organizations in 17 countries to discover the personal activity patterns of individual participants in free-living research studies.  By outfitting participants with a GPS datalogger and a physical activity monitor, researchers can construct a detailed picture of a participant's day: travel patterns, locations, time sequences.  Additional information about PALMS can be found on the PALMS wiki at http://ucsd-palms-project.wikispaces.com.

As part of MD2K, the PALMS GPS processing algorithms have been extracted from PALMS and made available as web services with a JSON interface.  

Included is a subset of the PALMS validation dataset which can be used to validate the MD2K PALMS web services.  This dataset consists of the original GPX files collected by a Qstarz BT-1000 data logger, JSON files produced from the GPX files, the truth files, and the PALMS processed data (results of the PALMS calculations).
